               Snorkeling and scuba diving in Tobago with CocoMotion
           </h3>
           <p class="steps__content">
                Snorkeling and scuba diving are two of the most exciting ways to experience Tobago's natural beauty. Add to that the excitement of a high speed ride aboard Coco Motion, a 31ft cigarette hulled offshore powerboat.  The powerful twin engines can whisk you to some of the <strong class="steps_content--strong">best snorkeling spots</strong> along Tobago's lush and lovely coastline. If <strong class="steps__content--strong">scuba diving</strong> is more to your liking, we can show you some of the most exciting seascapes and marine life in, not only Tobago, but the Caribbean.

                <h4 class="step__title">Snorkeling</h4>
                <p class="step__content">Our 3 hour snorkeling tours, which leave Mount Irvine Bay at 9:00am and 1:00pm, whiz you along Tobago's Caribbean coast, past secluded tree-lined beaches accessible only from the sea. On the way, keep an eye out for dolphins, which love the speed and often like to play around the boat. We moor at a couple of secluded bays that offer excellent snorkeling opportunities and breathtaking scenery, both underwater and above. Life jackets, for those who prefer to use them, and snorkeling equipment are provided. Fish Identification cards help you figure out what "that fish" was. The boat has a bimini top which we put up while we are moored to provide a shady spot for those who don't want too much Tobago sun. Remember your sunblock so you don't end your Tobago snorkeling trip with a bad sunburn. During the tour we serve soft drinks, bottled water, fresh tropical fruit and our famous home-made Carrot Cake! We return to Mount Irvine around noon and 4:00pm. What a wonderful lazy way to spend a morning or afternoon in Tobago.</p>

                <h4 class="step__title">Scuba</h4>
                <p class="step__content">There's nothing else like it - especially when the experience is one-on-one with Marlon or Rachel, CocoMotion's two PADI certified Scuba Instructors. The warm clear water surrounding Tobago offers the perfect opportunity to explore the underwater realm. Both experienced divers, and those new to the sport, can enjoy all the excitement and beauty that diving in Tobago has to offer. If you would like to try Scuba for the first time, the Discover Scuba Diving program is perfect for the newcomer who would like a "try dive" before enrolling in a certification course. If you would like to earn your entry level certification or perhaps continue your diving education, we offer all the PADI courses from Scuba Diver to Divemaster. We are happy to schedule classes to suit your group or family. Not quite ready to try scuba? Our snorkelling trips offer the opportunity to view some of the amazing creatures that inhabit our coral reefs.</p>
